Hey, this article will guide you through everything you need to know about Quotient's addrole command. This will also help you to troubleshoot any possible
issues you are facing while using Quotient's add role command. </br></br>

**What is Quotient's addrole command?** </br></br>

`addrole` or `role` is a simple command that helps you give a role to one or multiple users very easily, you can also use this command to give a role to 
all human or bot users in your server. Isn't this good? </br></br>

Command Structure: </br>
```
[addrole|role] </br>
|
└───── humans
|
└───── bots
|
└───── all
```
</br>

</br></br>
**How do I add a role to multiple users with a single command?** </br></br>
If you have a role that you want to give to certain number of users, you can simply do:
`qaddrole @role @member1 @member2 @member3`.</br>
Note that you must provide a space between all the user mentions for the command to work accurately.</br></br>

**But what I want to give a role to all bots or humans in my server?**</br></br>
Don't worry we've got you covered, you just have to use `qaddrole humans @role` or `qaddrole bots @role` </br>

You will then be prompted with this message:</br>

</br></br>
Just click on the check mark and then let Quotient do all the heavy stuff for you.</br></br>


**I used the addrole command but it just doesn't work. What do I do?**</br></br>
- Maybe you forgot to add spaces between users while using the commannd. What I mean is you have to use the addrole command like this `qaddrole @role @member1 @member2...`</br>
but what you did is `qaddrole @role @member1@member2@meber3..` -> No space between user mentions, if you did this, kindly add a space between all user mentions and you are good to go. </br> </br>

- If you did the above thing right and you still don't see that role in some user's profile, it's most probably because of a discord glitch. They actually have the role but you just can't see it because of discord's glitch. you can verify this by going to your server's audit log and checking if Quotient gave any role to that user. If this was the case, this is just discord's bug and there's nothing I can do about this. </br> 

QUOTIENT DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THIS.</br></br>
